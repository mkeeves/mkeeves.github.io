# iOS Shortcuts - 1 click Google Maps Navigation

There are built in widgets for Google Maps on iOS which allow you to quickly navigate to locations like Home or Work, but rely upon the location being saving in tour Google account, require more than one press to begin navigation, and also from time to time don't work as expected, for example if your account is signed out. creating the shortcut on iOS means i can now start navigation with less presses, and with reliance upon dat in my google account.

I began by following a guide from another blog (https://www.upsync.dev/2022/08/01/ios-google-maps-shortcut) to create the shortcut in such a way that was easy to reuse as a template. I then amended the URL to use the Universal maps URI scheme, which allowed starting navigation immediately without needing to press 'Start'.
